# WeeklyMeals

WeeklyMeals helps small groups (friends, families, roommates) agree on a weekly menu without conflict through a predictable voting and alternatives process.

## How it works

- Create a group and start a new weekly menu.
- Everyone proposes meals and votes in a fixed, transparent flow.
- If a vote stalls, the app moves to alternatives instead of restarting the whole process.
